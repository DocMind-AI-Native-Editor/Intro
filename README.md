### **What are you building?**

What are you building?

We're building DocMind, the "Cursor for writing" - an AI-native workspace where AI isn't a feature, it's the foundation. Just as Cursor revolutionized coding with AI pair programming, DocMind brings that magic to knowledge work.

The Problem:
Notion = database with AI sprinkled on top
ChatGPT/Claude = isolated chat windows disconnected from your work
Google Docs/Word = digital typewriters from the 90s

None understand your entire workspace. None can truly co-create with you.

DocMind's Core Innovation:

Cursor-Inspired AI Editor:
Intelligent Autocomplete: Pulls from all your CSVs, PDFs, and documents in real-time
Select & Transform: Highlight any text → "update with Q4 data" → instant transformation
Multi-Cursor AI: Edit multiple locations simultaneously with AI coordination
Cmd+K Everything: Any AI action instantly, no chat window needed

True Workspace Intelligence:
Process million-row CSVs + a bunch of PDFs + all documents as one connected system
Change data in CSV → documents auto-update
What takes teams days, DocMind does in minutes
No copy-paste - AI directly accesses everything

Beyond Text:
Select data → instant interactive visualizations
Run pandas/SQL inline, see results immediately
Automatic citations across your entire workspace

Why We're Different:
DocMind IS AI. Every pixel, every interaction is AI-native. We're not retrofitting AI into an old paradigm - we're building the future of how humans and AI create together.

Early Validation:
Financial analyst: "Replaced Notion + Excel + ChatGPT with just DocMind"
Consultant: "3-day reports now take 3 hours with better quality"
Researcher: "Finally, AI that sees my entire research corpus, not fragments"

We're creating a new category: the truly AI-native professional workspace. Where thinking and creating happen at the speed of thought, not the speed of copy-paste.


**The Fundamental Insight:**
Cursor succeeded because they understood: **AI shouldn't be a feature - it should be the foundation**.

- Notion treats AI as a feature
- ChatGPT treats documents as text blocks
- DocMind IS AI - every pixel, every interaction, every feature is AI-native

**Why We Win:**

1. **Notion users** come for real AI integration, not toy AI blocks
2. **ChatGPT users** come to work in their actual documents, not a chat window
3. **Cursor users** already understand - they want the same magic for writing

**Proof Points:**

- Financial analyst: "Replaced my Notion + Excel + ChatGPT workflow with just DocMind"
- Researcher: "Finally, AI that sees my entire research corpus, not fragments"
- Consultant: "From 3-day reports to 3-hour reports with better quality"

**Our Mission:**
Our mission is to make **AI co-creation real** for every knowledge worker.

For **creators and writers**, DocMind enables you to focus on the core of your work: the content and the ideas. You're no longer limited by your information sources or the tedious process of finding and synthesizing them. Our AI does the heavy lifting, so you can focus on creativity itself.

For **professionals in law, finance, and consulting**, we free you from the busywork that slows you down. DocMind reduces the time you spend on formatting and data retrieval, allowing you to focus on the insights and the narrative. Instead of just organizing information, you can truly understand what the data means.

Just as Cursor made "AI pair programming" a reality (not just chatbot coding), DocMind makes "AI co-creation" a reality (not just chatbot writing). We're not competing with Notion or ChatGPT—we're creating a category they can't enter: the truly AI-native professional workspace.

Every knowledge worker deserves their own Cursor-level AI integration. ChatGPT can't deliver it. Notion can't deliver it. DocMind is built for nothing else.
